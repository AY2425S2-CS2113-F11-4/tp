## Introduction

FlashCLI 2.0 is a command-line flashcard application designed specifically for CS2113 Software Engineering students. It helps students create, manage, and review flashcards efficiently, making it easier to retain important concepts in Java, software design, and coding best practices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`user_guide`** and pressing Enter will list the available commands.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `new testDeck` : Creates a new deck named "testDeck".

    * `select 1` : Selects the first deck.
