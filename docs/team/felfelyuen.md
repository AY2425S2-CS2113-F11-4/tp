## Project: FlashCLI
## Overview
FlashCLI is a command-line flashcard application designed specifically for CS2113 Software Engineering students. It helps students create, manage, and review flashcards efficiently, making it easier to retain important concepts in Java, software design, and coding best practices.

Given below are my contributions to the project
### Summary of Contributions
- **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all the flashcard questions
    - What it does: Allows the user to list for all the flashcard questions in the deck.
    - Justification: This feature allows the user to view all their flashcard questions simultaneously, and this helps them identify each flashcard by the index more easily.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to quiz the flashcards.
    - What it does: Allows the user to enter quiz mode, quizzing the unlearned flashcards in the deck one by one, and giving the total time taken to finish the quiz. Correctly answered flashcards would be deemed as learned, and would not be quizzed again, unless they are marked as unlearned by the user.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly, as the quiz mode can help the user test whether they have memorised the information well, and see which areas need improvement and which do not.
    - Highlights: 
    - Credits: 
- **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark a flashcard as learned or unlearned.
    - What it does: Allows the user to mark a flashcard as learned or unlearned.
    - Justification: This feature allows the user to customise which flashcards they would like to be tested in quiz mode, and which flashcards they do not want.
