### Project: FlashCLI
### Overview
FlashCLI is a command-line flashcard application designed specifically for CS2113 Software Engineering students. It helps students create, manage, and review flashcards efficiently, making it easier to retain important concepts in Java, software design, and coding best practices.

### Summary of Contributions 

**Code contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2425s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Betahaxer&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2025-02-21&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

**Critical Feature: Creating Flashcards**

- **What it does:** Allow users to create flashcards with mandatory question and answer fields using `/q` and `/a` tags where the user input is also sanitised.
- **Justification:** This is the **core functionality** of the application—without it, users cannot interact with the app meaningfully.

**Critical Feature: Creating Decks**

- **What it does:** Allow users to create a named flashcard deck, given that there are no duplicated decks.

**New Feature: Renaming Decks**

- **What it does:** Allow users to rename existing decks when a deck is selected, while also preserving deck order and flashcards.

**New Feature: Listing Decks**

- **What it does:** Allow users to view all the decks they have created, along with the deck indices.

**New Feature: Selecting & Deleting Decks**

- **What it does:** Allow users select or delete a deck by its index.

**New Feature: Unselecting Decks**

- **What it does:** Allow users to unselect the current deck selected.
