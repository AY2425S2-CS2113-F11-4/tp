## FlashCLI - CLI-based Flashcard App 

## Overview

FlashCLI 2.0 is a command-line flashcard application designed specifically for CS2113 Software Engineering students. It helps students create, manage, and review flashcards efficiently, making it easier to retain important concepts in Java, software design, and coding best practices.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-F11-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for FlashCLI.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar FlashCLI.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   You should be greeted with a welcome message.

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`user_guide`** and pressing Enter will list the available commands.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `new testDeck` : Creates a new deck named "testDeck".

   * `select 1` : Selects the first deck.

   * `add /q What is an assertion? /a Assertions are used to...` : Creates a new flashcard with the question and answer provided.

   * `list`: Shows the list of flashcards in the selected deck.
